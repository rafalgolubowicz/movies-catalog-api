# Movies Catalog API

Hey there!

Not so long ago we decided create a catalogue of our favourite movies as json. It is hard to update, so we would like to build an API for it, however we don't need a database, we still need it as a file.

Repository contains:

- REST API built with Express

## Prerequisites

You need to have Node in version "^14.15.0 || ^16.10.0 || >=18.0.0" installed to run this app.

## Running project in development

- Create `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`. All of those variables are described at the bottom.
- Install dependencies using `yarn install`
- Start project using `yarn dev`

## Scripts

- **yarn dev** - start API service
- **yarn build** - build frontend
- **yarn lint** - run tests
- **yarn lint** - run linter

## Development urls

- **http://localhost:8000/swagger** - Swagger
- **http://localhost:8000** - Rest API
